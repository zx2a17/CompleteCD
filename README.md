# CompleteCD
This repository is the place where I put together a complete CD pipeline (CI later on as well if I can manage)

The plan is as follows

1) use terraform and github action to provision and configure the infrastructure completely
   - this should also include installing the necessary packages that the application need to run
  
2) based on the previous node JS app I have deployed as practice, deploy this application automatically and allow a true end to end CD pipeline
